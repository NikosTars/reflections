What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Because this way i have created a repository in my directory and now i can create commits and see version history of my files contained within the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a medium and temporary area as it temporarily stores all the files to be commited in a single commit command. It holds files from the working directory to be commited to the repository.
