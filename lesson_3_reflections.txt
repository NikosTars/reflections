When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Probably when i work from various different computers or more than 1 people are working on the same code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may try something online on github that isn't a complete logical step and may break down your code in your offline branch.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a clone online on github and i would use it if i want to modify another person's code without changing his original code. I would use clone if i would like to copy and modify the same code. I would use branches if i would like to try something new on a code without caring if it will actually work or not or if it will ruin the base functioning version. I would also use branch if 2 different people are working on the same code and merge the branches when they are done.
